Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning
Project Title: Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning

Project Overview:
In this project, I utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle to explore campus placement data.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement)
The primary objective was to employ the Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm to develop a predictive model. 
The model was trained using essential features identified through a heatmap analysis.

Project Components:

Data Source: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, providing a comprehensive set of attributes related to campus placements.

Machine Learning Algorithm: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was chosen as the core machine learning technique for predictive modeling.

Feature Selection: To optimize the model's performance, relevant features were selected through a heatmap analysis, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy.

Web Interface: The project includes two HTML pages: index.html and result.html.

index.html: This page serves as the user interface for inputting data.
result.html: The results from the prediction process are displayed on this page.
Flask Application: The Flask web application (app.py) acts as the bridge between the user interface and the machine learning model.
 It evaluates the input data and classifies candidates as either "placed" (1) or "not placed" (0). 
The results are then presented on the result.html page.


This project combines data analysis, machine learning, and web development to provide valuable insights into campus placement trends and outcomes.
